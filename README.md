# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this project was to establish a binary classifier that is capable of predicting funding success based on historical organization funding data.

## Results

The target variable for the model is the "successful" column
The variables considered to be features for the model are: name, application, type, affiliation, classification, use_case, organization, status, income_amt, special_considerations, and ask_amt
The variables that should be removed from the data are ein and status

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
There were three hidden layers in the optimized version of the model, which were creating to increase the accuracy
The target model performance was achieved

## Summary
In the end the accuracy score was slightly above 79%, showing that applicants with three or more applications have a good chance. Random Forest decision trees could have also been used in this model.
